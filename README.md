In this project, I designed a dataset of questions and answers in Arabic, which served as the foundation for creating
the chatbot. The data was stored in a JSON file. To preprocess the data, I removed stopwords, tokenized the text,
applied stemming, and used a Bag of Words model. Subsequently, I trained a Sequential Deep Learning model to
serve as the chatbot's core.
